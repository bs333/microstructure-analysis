The following project analyzing the microstructure of **APPL** on January 4th, 2023.

Using a tick level dataset (TAQ), I analyze and do the following:
- Perform a study of liquidity: compute the spread measures (quoted spread, effective spread, realized spread) in time buckets and study the intra-day liquidity dynamics.
- Estimate the volatility using intra-day data.
- Estimate the probability of informed trading (PIN measure).
